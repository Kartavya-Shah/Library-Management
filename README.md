# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT
This is a library management mini-project written in C programming language. The program allows the user to perform various operations such as adding book information, displaying book information, listing all books of a given author, listing the title of a specified book, and counting the number of books in the library. The user can select any of the above options from a menu. The program uses an array of structures to store the book information entered by the user. It also uses string and input/output functions to take user input and display output on the console.
